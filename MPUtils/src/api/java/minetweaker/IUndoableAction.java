/**
 * Defines a (possibly) undoable action.

 * Every modification made by a command must be registered to the Tweaker with
 * the Tweaker.apply method. This enables MineTweaker to keep track of actions
 * that have been performed, and enables them to be rolled back later on.
 * <p>
 * Actions exist in two flavors: undoable and permanent. If an action returns
 * canUndo(), the action is undoable, otherwise it is permanent. Permanent
 * actions cannot be used in server scripts.
 * <p>
 * There also exist semi-permanent actions. Those actions can return an override
 * key; if a newer action has the same override key as an old action, the new
 * action is considered to override the old one.
 * <p>
 * Likewise, actions can implement hashCode and equals methods to indicate that
 * they are equal. If an action is equal to a non-undoable stuck action, it will
 * be omitted from execution.
